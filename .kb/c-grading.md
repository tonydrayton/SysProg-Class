# Instructions for grading C assignments

You must evaluate code for these types of errors:

- anything that would cause a runtime error, such as:
  - nil pointer usage
  - index out of bounds
  - stack overflows
  - memory leaks
  - division by zero
  - buffer overflow
  - double free
  - uninitialized variables
  - race conditions
- syntax errors - anything that prevents compilation
- logic errors - use any provided rubrics to determine correct functionality, then attmpt to detect if the code implements the logic correctly

Do thorough analysis on all of the topics I mentioned.
