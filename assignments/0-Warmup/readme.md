## Warmup Assignment

As mentioned in the course syllabus and in the first lecture this course will require you to use a linux environment for all of your assignments, and to maintain and submit your work in individual folders in a **single** git repository that you will be using throughout this term. 

You are highly encouraged to use GitHub for managing your assignments, but you may also use Drexel's GitLab service if you want to keep things private from the public internet.  The advantage of using GitHub is that you can start building a portfolio of your software development work that can become helpful with future employers.  

We **HIGHLY ENCOURAGE** *public* GitHub repositories, or *internal* GitLab repositories for this course.  If you choose to use a *private* repository for your work, either on GitHub or GitLab, it is 100% your responsibility to **not only grant, but also verify** that all instructors and TAs have been given access to your repository.  This must be done in advance of the first programming assignment due date.  If for whatever reason we attempt to grade an assignment and run into access issues for a private repository your assignment will be considered late.  Again, we **HIGHLY ENCOURAGE** you to use a public GitHub repository (where everything will be visible to anybody on the Internet), or an internal GitLab project (where access will be limited to individuals with access to Drexel's internal Network).  

Professor Ben Lilley created an excellent tutorial on [How to Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmlH3jiAscc).  This tutorial on YouTube goes over how to setup both GitLab and GitHub for this class, as well as how to properly secure your repository with ssh keys.  The video also covers how to access your GitHub or GitLab repositories from tux.  Although Prof. Lilley teaches CS503, we will be using the same exact rules-of-the-road for submitting and managing assignments in CS283.

To ensure that we all get off to a good start, for this warm up assignment you will be creating your initial repository and providing a link to a writeup answering a few questions.  In the spirit of Git, the first assignment will be submitted in Git, with a link to your submission provided in blackboard.
